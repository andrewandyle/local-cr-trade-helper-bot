# CR Trade Helper Bot (Local Copy)
A Java Discord bot that I collaborated on, utilizing RoyaleAPI to web-scrape and assist card trading.

This is the local copy of the hosted bot, which I made my own changes to.

My website covers what the bot does, and includes every change I made: https://elydna.github.io/cr-trade-bot.html

RoyaleAPI has discontinued their developer services effective March 1, 2020, so the bot is not functional at the moment.

>RoyaleAPI Developer Note: Our API has been a staple in the Clash Royale community since its launch in Summer 2017. The API has served over 2,000 active developer tokens and handles 15 million requests daily. Unfortunately, the cost of maintaining the resources to support this has far exceeded our ability to raise funds largely due to the limitations of the Supercell Fan Content Policy. After long and careful consideration we are discontinuing the API service effective March 1, 2020.
