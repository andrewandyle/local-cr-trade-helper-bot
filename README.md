# CR Trade Helper Bot (Local Copy)

# Originally created by: Eitri Ymir (aka Gleipnir or GleipnirYmir)

A Java Discord bot that I collaborated on, utilizing RoyaleAPI to web-scrape and assist card trading.

This is the local copy of the hosted bot, which I made my own changes to.

My website covers what the bot does, and includes every change I made: https://andrewandyle.github.io/cr-trade-bot.html
